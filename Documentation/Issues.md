## I can't join friends/friends can't join me
1. Turn off `Join Attempts` in `NETWORK > PROTECTION > PRESENCE EVENTS`.
2. Turn off everything in `NETWORK > SPOOFING > ATTRIBUTES`.

## I can't interact with Players
Turn off `Ghost` in `NETWORK > SPOOFING > ENTITY`.

## Stuck on Mount
Turn off `Disable Knock Off` in `PLAYER > VEHICLE`.

## Players on Invisible Mounts
Turn off `Horse` in `NETWORK > PROTECTION > FORGED BLOCKING`.

## Crashing on Injection
Load into `Free Roam` first, then, after your character is fully loaded in, proceed to inject Exodus RDR2.

## Crashing Because of Memory
If you are crashing because the Game's Memory keeps reaching 100%, then these are the solutions:

You can try each step separately to see what fixes it for you.

1. You don't have enough RAM (16GB or over is more than enough).
2. Change in-game Graphics API (from `DirectX 12` to `Vulkan` or vice versa).
